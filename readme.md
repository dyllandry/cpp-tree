I want to implement some kind of tree structure using cpp.

# Compile and Run

You can use the shell script `run.sh` to both compile and run the project.

`./run.sh`

# Future Plans

Might be cool to somehow export this tree & make a renderer with TS, a tree-viewer. That might be a way I'd be excited to use TS and React.
